This is the digpicz.com website that I created back in 2007. It got massive
attention back then because Digg didn't have picture section then.

One day I had to close it becuase I got an email from Digg's lawyers, which
said that I was abusing Digg's trademarks.

The site was completely static and was generated by a bunch of Perl scripts.

Please visit http://digg.picurls.com/ to see how it looked. I saved a
screenshot for history.

Also see these two articles on how it was created and how it received 100,000
visitors in the first day (it got massively popular!):

This is a complete package which generates digpicz.com website.

Each directory except /templates and /scripts contains a readme
with basic description of what the dir was made for.

/templates directory contains HTML template fragments which
Perl's Template::Toolkit puts together to create pages seen on
http://digpicz.com

/scripts directory contains all the Perl scripts and modules
which do all the generation and data mining together.

See the article on how it was designed for much more detailed information:
